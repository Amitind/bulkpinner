## Tips and tricks

### Keyboard shortcuts

Type `?` to view the keyboard shortcuts

**The keyboard shortcut you'll likely use more than any**

Type `>` then `>` then `>` (press and hold `SHIFT`, then type `.` 3 tmes) - This will populate the note and link fields in all Pin Previews with the value in the first Pin Preview
