# Bulk Pinner

An application allowing users to create multiple pins in bulk

## Version Numbers

The version numbers work like this

**A . B . C**

**A** = Major version updates

This will include things like UI overall, major new feature e.g. being able to create a new board from the app

**B** = Minor version updates

This will include things that are niceties, but nothing to write home about. E.g. adding/changing an icon, adding a link etc.

**C** = Bug fixes

These releases include just bug fixes, and therefore don't increase the overall version number

*N.B. Both A and B can include bug fixes too, but they wouldn't change the version number. 
E.g. If there is a new major feature added, then A would increased from 1 to 2.
 If there are also some bug fixes, that wouldn't be represented in the number at all, it would just 
 be noted int he changelog*
